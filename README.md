Flimbot Version 1.0

Flimbot is a small discord bot which runs (as of now) insignificant commands for the purpose of amusement. At the time of the first official release, it will have fifteen commands, which will be listed and each given a short summary of their purpose. As stated, this is the first official release; bugs are expected. If you encounter any, please notify me as soon as you can and I'll try and iron em out. Expect more features in the future, this is my first project interfacing with the discord API wrapper and I hope to improve the complexity and optimization in the near future as I continue to learn it. If it's too annoying let me know and I can tone it down. I suck at conclusions so lets just move into the command explanation.


COMMANDS:

ping: Using this you can see the ping of the bot itself, mainly for me to see if I need to optimize certain areas more

8ball: Just a simple 8ball command, returns a basic yes/no answer to the question asked (user input). (Ex: .8ball Am I a Chad or a loser?)

message: This is a way to send me a message directly, and is much more secure than any other form of communication I have currently. I cannot see who sent the message, so if your identity is necessary for the message to make sense please specify. (Ex: .message hey idiot whats up)

NM: Stands for New Message, simply returns the message that I have sent. The bad thing is currently if a user runs this command and I'm not on the other end to authenticate the end of it (Like I'm not home or something) then you guys will not be able run any other commands. I know how to fix it but I wanted this to be out tonight so just don't use it much now. (Ex: .NM)

flashbacks: just a flashback war gif or something. (Ex: .flashbacks)

banger: Just spits a song out if you're wanting something to listen to. I believe there are four default songs so far, just so I could see if it works. (Ex: .banger)

banger list: Returns a list of the songs currently in the server-personalized list (Ex: .banger list)

AB: AB, or Add Banger, is exactly what is sounds like. I believe that although I love what I listen to, others believe my taste is absolute trash. So go ahead and add whatever songs you like using this command, the maximum amount is infinite. I plan on adding a delete function in the future. (Ex: .AB (link of song here))

credits: Crediting the people that helped me create this (Ex: .credits)

match: A copy of that game that everyone played on friv back in the day. Enter two peoples name seperated by 'and' then calculate if the two would do well together or not. (Ex. .match Flim and Duolingo Bird)

hana: (Command not pertaining to FN) Spits a gif of the one and only Hana Isuzu, this one is for you Senor. (Ex: .hana)

joke: Tells a simple joke, I personally didn't like this one but to the person who did, I hope you enjoy it. (Ex: .joke)

catharsis: (Command not pertaining to Garu) Returns a real time countdown to the Catharsis single drop. Will hopefully implement minutes in the future. (Ex: .catharsis)

HotRate: Theres no way to better rate physical attractiveness than using an online command with no previous knowledge of your actual image! Run this and either crush your self esteem or inflate your head! (Ex: .HotRate Young Bill Clinton)

roulette: A simple game of Russian roulette, 1 bullet in the chamber. An optimist and pessimist once played this, the optimist naturally thinking his odds (5/6) were pretty good. He immediately drew the short straw and was killed. The pessimist knew there was a 1/6 chance he was dying, so he left. Don't be an optimist in life or death situations folks. (Ex: .roulette)

In conclusion, its basically just a useless bot that runs silly commands for the fun of it. Enjoy it, and like I said report any bugs to me, you'd really be doing me a favor. Thanks for reading!
